# AngelSwing Project

An angelswing project created in flutter is a place tracking app that uses:
* [google_maps_flutter](https://pub.dev/packages/google_maps_flutter) plugin. Keep track of your places. places you've visited, and marked them as per your requirement.
* [geolocator](https://pub.dev/packages/geolocator) plugin. Track the Current Location of the User for the Implementing the Application Functionality.
* [provider](https://pub.dev/packages/provider) plugin. Track the notification to notify about the nearby place.
* [dio](https://pub.dev/packages/dio) plugin. It is powerful Http client for Dart, which supports Interceptors, Global configuration, FormData, Request Cancellation, File downloading, ConnectionTimeout etc.
* [connectivity]() : This package helps to detect the network connectivity issue of the device. This package is used in the project inorder to check the wifi status before undergoing network call.
* [rxdart](https://pub.dev/packages/rxdart) plugin. RxDart extends the capabilities of Dart Streams and StreamControllers. Dart comes with a very decent Streams API out-of-the-box; rather than attempting to provide an alternative to this API, RxDart adds functionality from the reactive extensions specification on top of it. RxDart does not provide its Observable class as a replacement for Dart Streams. Instead, it offers several additional Stream classes, operators (extension methods on the Stream class), and Subjects.
* [flutter_local_notifications](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_local_notifications) plugin. A cross platform plugin for displaying local notifications.
* [shared_preferences](https://pub.dev/packages/shared_preferences) plugin. Wraps platform-specific persistent storage for simple data (NSUserDefaults on iOS and macOS, SharedPreferences on Android, etc.). Data may be persisted to disk asynchronously, and there is no guarantee that writes will be persisted to disk after returning, so this plugin must not be used for storing critical data.
* [fluttertoast](https://pub.dev/packages/fluttertoast) plugin. Provides the alert PopUp message when the application denied the permission request for location.
